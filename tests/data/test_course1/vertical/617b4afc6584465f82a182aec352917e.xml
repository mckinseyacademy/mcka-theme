Once you have developed scenarios, it’s helpful to categorize the various moves your business could make. McKinsey’s &lt;strong&gt;Strategy Method&lt;/strong&gt; offers three broad categories defined in terms of:&#10;      &lt;ul&gt;&lt;ul type=&quot;disc&quot;&gt;&#10;        &lt;li&gt;the level of commitment&lt;/li&gt;&#10;        &lt;li&gt;the risk of being wrong&lt;/li&gt;&#10;        &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&#10;      &lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &#10;      &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Click each category to learn more. When you are finished, scroll down to hear Bloomberg leaders talk about how they balance making a high-commitment choice with flexibility. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;    &lt;/description&gt;&#10;    &lt;hotspots&gt;&#10;        &lt;hotspot x='331' y='55'&gt;&#10;            &lt;feedback width='290' height='340'&gt;&#10;                &lt;header&gt;&#10;                  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No-Regret Moves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&#10;                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;                &lt;/header&gt;&#10;                &lt;body&gt;&#10;                   &lt;p&gt;A No-Regret move will pay off in almost any circumstance. A highly repeatable move&amp;#8212;such as opening the thousandth store in a territory where all previous 999 have been successful&amp;#8212;will typically be a No-Regret move. Other examples might include investment in initiatives to improve customer service or customer retention. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;                &lt;/body&gt;&#10;            &lt;/feedback&gt;&#10;        &lt;/hotspot&gt;&#10;        &lt;hotspot x='658' y='55'&gt;&#10;            &lt;feedback width='450' height='300'&gt;&#10;                &lt;header&gt;&#10;                  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Bets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&#10;                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;                &lt;/header&gt;&#10;                &lt;body&gt;&#10;                  &lt;p&gt;Big Bets are large commitments with a high risk of being wrong. Typical examples include major capital investments or acquisitions that will produce large payoffs in some scenarios and large losses in others. Therefore, there is a high risk of being wrong&amp;#8212;exposure to downside is significant. While the Big Bet may be the right move, a common mistake businesses make is to commit to unnecessary Big Bets when less risky Real Options, such as running a pilot, create more flexibility and offer reduced exposure to downside.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;              &lt;/body&gt;&#10;            &lt;/feedback&gt;&#10;        &lt;/hotspot&gt;&#10;      &lt;hotspot x='658' y='320'&gt;&#10;            &lt;feedback width='590' height='570'&gt;&#10;                &lt;header&gt;&#10;                  &lt;br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&#10;              &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;                &lt;/header&gt;&#10;                &lt;body&gt;&#10;                  &lt;p&gt;Real Options are small, high-risk investments that businesses can scale up as they learn more about the commercial environment in which the strategy is playing out. Essentially, a Real Option offers limited exposure to downside, but the upside can be significant. This is sometimes termed an “asymmetric bet.” Typical examples include conducting a pilot before the full-scale introduction of a new product or entering into a limited joint venture to minimize the risks inherent in breaking into a new market. Licensing a limited-scale deployment of a third-party technology in case it proves to be superior to the technology your business could develop in-house would also be considered a Real Option. In these examples, you would have learned enough from the Real Options to be confident in making a high-commitment move that’s relatively certain of success (and therefore &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; a Big Bet). Another way of putting this is with reference to this diagram: The aim of your strategy should be to move “north-west” and &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; “north.” You should be progressing from a low-risk, low-commitment Real Options (bottom right of the diagram) towards a high-commitment, low-risk No-Regret move (top left).&lt;/p&gt;&#10;              &lt;p&gt;However, sometimes you would miss the window of opportunity if you go for a Real Option rather than directly for a Big Bet. This happens in cases where there is a first mover advantage or a “winner takes all” dynamic. Rigorous analysis as part of the Strategy Method can help you determine whether it’s wise to convert your Big Bet to a Real Option (or series of Real Options)&amp;#8212;or whether, by doing this, you’d miss out on the opportunity.&#10; &lt;/p&gt;&#10;              &lt;/body&gt;&#10;            &lt;/feedback&gt;&#10;        &lt;/hotspot&gt;&#10;    &lt;/hotspots&gt;&#10;&lt;/image_explorer&gt;"/>
