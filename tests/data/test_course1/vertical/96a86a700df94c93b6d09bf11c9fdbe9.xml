Explore what would happen if Stronghold were to go that route.&#10;          &#10;&lt;/question&gt;&#10;        &lt;choice value=&quot;D1S1&quot;&gt;Design a mobile claims solution &lt;/choice&gt;&#10;        &lt;choice value=&quot;D1S2&quot;&gt;Invest in preventing cyber-attacks towards all of Stronghold&amp;#8217;s data assets and systems&lt;/choice&gt;&#10;        &lt;choice value=&quot;D1S3&quot;&gt;Automate the application process &lt;/choice&gt;&#10;      &lt;/mcq&gt;&#10;    &lt;/step&gt;&#10;&lt;step name=&quot;new&quot;&gt;&#10;   &lt;/step&gt;&#10;    &lt;step name=&quot;D1S1&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;re right that it would be wise to digitize the claims process, but that may not deliver the greatest business impact. Play the video below to see how the choice to prioritize designing a mobile claims process affects Stronghold&amp;#8217;s future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;      &lt;ooyala-player content_id=&quot;95NGVnMDE66aQlYgqDNqSyj4ulLVtzZP&quot;/&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Stronghold&amp;#8217;s choice to streamline the claims process improved the experience for their agents and for those customers with claims. But, the reality is that the improved claims process didn&amp;#8217;t lead to growth. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;A better choice would be to invest in a digitized application process. A digitized application process would trigger multiple wins: it would make agents and customers happy, while generating additional business. And, this would provide the growth needed to continue to focus on other aspects of the technology strategy &amp;#8211; such as a targeted solution to cyber security to ensure the protection of Stronghold&amp;#8217;s most valuable data assets.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click &lt;b&gt;Start Over&lt;/b&gt; to explore other options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the forward arrow to continue with the lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;      &#10;    &lt;/step&gt;&#10;&#10;    &lt;step name=&quot;D1S2&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;While Stronghold must certainly ready itself for data breaches, holistic prevention for all data assets is not the best approach. The reality is that attacks are bound to happen. Organizations should invest in the protection of their most valuable and sensitive data assets and on their ability to respond to attacks, rather than on untargeted measures to prevent breaches from ever occurring. This would allow them to gain greater control over their IT security spend and invest in digitization at the same time as protecting their data. In addition, they should roll out a firm-wide information security policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Play the video to see how the choice to invest in preventing cyber-attacks affects Stronghold&amp;#8217;s future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;      &lt;ooyala-player content_id=&quot;V0dXdiMDE6T6OkPMqO5G2qUYXGm2K1bV&quot;/&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Because they were so focused on investing in the prevention of a cyber-attack on all of their data assets and systems, Stronghold Mutual neglected directing its IT strategy to grow and keep its customer base. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;So what would be the smarter approach to addressing cyber security while also attending to digitization?  Stronghold should identify the crown jewels of its data&amp;#8212;in other words, the data that is most valuable to their business. Then, they could prioritize information assets across the organization according to their criticality, and come up with differentiated protection of those assets. This would allow them to gain greater control over their IT security spend. In addition, they should roll out a firm-wide information security policy, including training and an awareness campaign for all employees.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click &lt;b&gt;Start Over&lt;/b&gt; to explore other options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the forward arrow to continue with the lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;!--&lt;br/&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Think about this feedback and let's go back and start the conversation again.&lt;/p&gt;--&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;    &lt;/step&gt;&#10;&#10;    &lt;step name=&quot;D1S3&quot;&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;That&amp;#8217;s right!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;As important as digitizing the claims process is, the higher priority initiative is automating the application process, because that stands to generate more value and growth for Stronghold. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Play the video to see how the choice to automate the application process affects Stronghold&amp;#8217;s future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;      &lt;ooyala-player content_id=&quot;9zNGVnMDE6Yk4DBUSaa2wapGu4Yw60_t&quot;/&gt;&#10;      &lt;html&gt;&#10;      &lt;p&gt;Digitizing the application process triggered multiple wins: it made for happier customers and agents, while generating new business. And, Gregori was able to address other concerns. Stronghold was able to streamline the claims process and implement a targeted approach to cyber security, ensuring the protection of its most valuable customer data. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;Streamlining the claims process first would have been a win, but would not have created nearly the business value. This is because the claims process affects less customers. All customers go through the application process; not all customers need to submit a claim. More customers switch insurers because of a tedious application process than because of poor claims handling.   &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;And, had the choice been made to start with an investment in preventing cyber-attacks towards&lt;b&gt; all &lt;/b&gt;of Stronghold&amp;#8217;s data assets and systems, the growth and retention of Stronghold&amp;#8217;s customer base would have been neglected. &lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click &lt;b&gt;Start Over&lt;/b&gt; to explore other options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click the forward arrow to continue with the lesson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#10;      &lt;/html&gt;&#10;    &lt;/step&gt;&#10;&#10;&lt;/adventure&gt;&#10;"/>
