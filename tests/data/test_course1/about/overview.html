<section class="about">
  <p>"When a team is working well, it's like magic." That's what Ramesh Srinivasen, faculty member for <em>Team Management</em> said when we asked him to describe an effective team. "But on the other hand," he said, "it's actually not serendipity. You can be quite strategic about it."</p> 
  <p>Those three sentences summarize the mission of <em>Team Management</em>. This course is dedicated to helping you build a more effective team. <em>Team Management</em> shares McKinsey's research on what makes teams effective, and gives you the opportunity to apply that research to your own team.  </p>
<p>You will explore these topics through video presentations by faculty members Ramesh Srinivasan, Michiel Kruyt, Kirstan Marnane, Sara Prince, and Jonathan Cain, as well as CEOs and other industry leaders from around the globe. You'll practice your skills in interactive exercises and group work. Throughout the course, you'll also have opportunities to reflect on what you have learned, plan how you will apply these skills on the job, and extend your learning through the optional additional practice activities. Finally, we have curated additional resources to help you dive deeper into topics that interest you.
</p>
  <p>The course is organized as follows:</p>

<p>In Lesson 1, you'll explore the dimensions of an effective team: alignment, execution, and renewal.  </p>
  <p>In Lesson 2, you'll practice using management tools, like team charters, performance boards, and huddles to plan, follow up, and troubleshoot, in order to ensure that your team is aligned to a set of goals and positioned to execute their work successfully.</p>
  <p>In Lesson 3, you'll learn a proven technique for providing feedback in response to both positive and challenging team behaviors. Experts Ramesh Srinivasen and Michiel Kruyt will share their experiences giving feedback, and you'll deepen your knowledge via observation and case studies.</p>
  <p>In Lesson 5, you'll learn to use observation, questions, and action experiments to help your team members and peers develop their strengths. </p>
  <p>In Lesson 6, you'll examine your own team's effectiveness and develop an action plan to increase its effectiveness.</p>
  <p>Lessons 4 and 7 are brief assessments to help you gauge your knowledge of the course material.</p>
