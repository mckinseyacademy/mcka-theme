<p>The members of your group appear below. Click <strong>Email</strong> to send a message to an individual. Click<strong> Email your entire team</strong> to send a message to the full group. You may also use the button at the bottom of the Project Navigator (<i class="fa fa-comment"></i>) to participate in a private discussion with your group members.<br /><br />We have randomly assigned a group coordinator for each team via email. If you are unsure of who is the coordinator for your group, please check your welcome email to the course, &ldquo;Team Management: Week 1.&rdquo;<br /><br />Group coordinators perform two critical functions:</p>
<blockquote><ol>
<li><strong>Organize</strong> the group&rsquo;s meetings, including the group kickoff</li>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> the group&rsquo;s submissions to the course platform following working sessions</li>
</ol></blockquote>
