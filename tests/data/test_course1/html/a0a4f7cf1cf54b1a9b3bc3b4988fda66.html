<p><strong>WELCOME</strong></p>
<p>The group work is an opportunity for you to apply the concepts and tools related to coaching that you learned in Lesson 5, as well as to collaborate with your colleagues taking this course. The group work for this course consists of two activities:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Kickoff</em>&nbsp; (not graded)</li>
<li><em>Plan a coaching session&nbsp;</em> (TA graded)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <strong>Project Navigator</strong> is your guide to the tasks and deadlines associated with each activity. Use the buttons at the bottom of the Project Navigator to:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upload</strong> your deliverables (<i class="fa fa-upload"></i> )</li>
<li>Access relevant <strong>resources</strong> for each activity (<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i>)</li>
<li>Begin and/or participate in a<strong> private discussion</strong> with your group members (<i class="fa fa-comment"></i>)</li>
<li>Send an email to a course <strong>TA</strong> (<span style="font-family: timesnewroman;" face="timesnewroman"><strong>TA</strong></span>)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>THE KICKOFF ACTIVITY</strong></p>
<p>As preparation for the <em>Plan a coaching session</em>&nbsp; activity, your group coordinator will initiate a kickoff meeting, to be held before December 8.&nbsp; During the kickoff meeting, you will discuss your plan for completing the group work. <strong>To have a productive kickoff, you should review the instructions in the <em>Plan a coaching session</em>&nbsp; Activity Guide.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>To view these instructions in the Project Navigator, click the resources button (<i class="fa fa-files-o"></i>).</p>
<p>We recommend meeting in person, or using Google Hangout, Skype, or a conference call for this kickoff meeting. Following the meeting, your group coordinator should use the <strong>Project Navigator</strong> to upload your group&rsquo;s <em>Kickoff&nbsp;</em> deliverable (<i class="fa fa-upload"></i>).</p>
