<p><em>Q: Why is group work important?</em><br />A: Coaching is a nuanced skill that you can improve with practice. This group work activity gives you the opportunity to plan, discuss, and practice a coaching session with your colleagues. <br /><br /><em>Q: How can I make the most of group work?</em><br />A: The group work is an opportunity for you to apply the concepts and tools you have learned in the lessons as well as to collaborate with others taking this course. Participants who actively engaged with their teams have found the group work to be a very meaningful way to reinforce what they've learned through rich debates and discussions. <br /><br /><em>Q: How can my group best collaborate?</em><br />A: While we recommend that you arrange an in-person discussion for your initial kickoff, your team may collaborate by any means you find most effective throughout the remainder of the project (e.g., via Google Hangout, Skype, conference call). Visit the <strong>Meet your team</strong> page and click <strong>Email your entire team</strong> to send all team members an email from the email you have on file with McKinsey Academy. You can also use the private discussion board to send messages with your group on the platform. We encourage you to introduce yourselves early in the course.<br /><br /><em>Q: What is the GMT time conversion?</em><br />A: 23:00 GMT on December 8 is:</p>
