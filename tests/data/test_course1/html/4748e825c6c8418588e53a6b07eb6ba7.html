<p>After holding your kickoff meeting, your group coordinator should upload your completed Kickoff deliverable. This will not be graded, but will serve as a confirmation of your initial meeting. We hope it will be helpful to your team as you collaborate on completing the group work. Please upload your deliverable as a .doc or .pptx file.</p>
