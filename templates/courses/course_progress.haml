    .sub-1 GRADES
    %p.style-6 You need a combined course grade of at least 80% to earn a certificate of completion. Your final grade is calculated as follows:
    .grades
      %ul
        %li End-of-lesson assessments: 00? percent of your grade
        %li Group work: 00? percent of your grade
        %li Final assessment: 00? percent of your grade

      %li.group-work.label-3 Group Work avg.
      %li.current-grade.label-3 Current grade
    %p.style-6 Pro forma grade is an estimate of your final grade assuming you continue to demonstrate the same level of proficiency on your uncompleted assessments as you did on your completed assessments to date. <a data-reveal-id='progress_modal'>Click here</a> to read more about how we may share your course information.
